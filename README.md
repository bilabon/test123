## Ticket 1
_Show your name, surname, bio, contacts on the main page._

Create basic django-project that would present your name, surname, date of birth, bio, contacts on the main page. 

Data should be stored in the DB, that's:
- manage.py syncdb
- manage.py runserver
- open the browser and all data are in, loaded from fixtures

Use pip requirements and virtualenv to manage your third party packages dependencies.

Use south, you'll need it later.

There should be Makefile with test target running your tests (make test to verify it).

## Ticket 3
_Create middleware that stores all http requests in the DB._

Also, on a separate page show last 10 http requests that are stored by middleware.

This page should update asynchronously as new requests come in, updating page header as well.

If there are N new requests, page title should start with (N).

As page is viewed by user, all requests should be considered as read and the title should return to the initial state.

42-test template
===========================

A Django 1.6+ project template

Use fortytwo_test_task.settings when deploying with getbarista.com

### Recomendations
* apps in apps/ folder
* use per-app templates folders
* use per-app static folders
* use migrations
* use settings.local for different environments
* common templates live in templates/
* common static lives in assets/
* management commands should be proxied to single word make commands, e.g make test
